# logstash

I noticed a lack of central repos containing various logstash filters and patterns for a wide range of applications. I aim to fill that void by sharing the logstash filters and patterns I find useful and not included in the logstash core.

These include:
  - nginx
  - postfix
  - amavis
  - cisco

I invite anyone who finds this a good idea to do a PR and share there logstash filters and patterns. I am by no means an expert on logstash or building patterns/filters, as of such, the filters and patterns I am sharing can probally be written alot better then they are.

I would also like to store dashboards and visualizations for Kibana for the filters.
